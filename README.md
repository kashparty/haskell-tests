# haskell-tests
My solutions to Tony Field's January Haskell Tests (given to first-year students at Imperial College London). Done mostly under timed conditions in 3 hours (except for some of the final parts in some of the papers, which I didn't always manage to get done in time 🙁) so they might not actually be correct/efficient/nice.
